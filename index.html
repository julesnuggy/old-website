			    <h2 style="text-align: left">About Me</h2>
			    <p>Hi, I'm Jules and this is my first webpage! Through my career to date, I have become a successful and well-respected management consultant, specialising in innovation, business change and data analytics. In this time, I provided advice and support to clients in the defence, government, transport, engineering and aerospace industries. After eight years of this, I have decided that I need a change in my career - to finally make the jump and delve into the world of programming and coding. I made this decision based on two main factors. <br><br>

				First, this has long been an interest of mine - my favourite past projects as a management consultant were those that involved building tools and models using VBA for Excel, typically to churn through masses of data to derive meaningful insights and generate visualisations. This coding skill, which I developed from the ground up through self-teaching whilst working, has always fascinated and inspired me. Developing a tangible output which the customer could use over and over again, and the journey of getting there - overcoming many obstacles and learning new things each day - has always been extremely satisfying for me. Whilst my work implenting solutions based on VBA for Excel has been interesting, I want to extend into "true" programming and develop applications outside of Excel. <br><br> 

				Secondly, my partner and I recently lost our home and all our possessions in a fire. This might seem like an odd reason to make me want to become a programmer, but after this traumatic event we took 6 weeks off to go travelling together. This gave us the breathing space we needed and during that time I reconsidered some of my life choices. I finally decided that I would commit myself to being less complacent and less risk-averse, and start doing what's better for me in the long term - professionally and personally. <br><br> 

				So that is why I left my job at the end of 2017 and made this page - to have a fresh start in 2018 and realise my dream and ambition of becoming a fully fledged coder. Over time, I'll be making alterations and improvements as I learn more and draw inspiration from others. I am primarily focusing on HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby for now and hope to get onto a Coding Bootcamp to help accelerate this learning and establish professional connections to land me that dream job. <br><br> 

				My first attempt was with one of the newer Bootcamps called <a href = "https://foundersandcoders.com/" target="_blank">Founders & Coders</a>. I got up to the interview stage with them and on 27 December 2017, I found out that, unfortunately, I did not get on. I dealt with this disappointment much better than I had anticipated (espesically since it was Christmas time and nearing my birthday) and I see that as a positive sign in myself and how I have grown as a person since Grenfell and from having Lee in my life. Despite not getting on, I am grateful for having found them as that opportunity really spurred me on to taking the dive to leave my job to do this. <br><br> 

				My next step is to re-apply for <a href = "http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank">Makers Academy</a>, which I previously applied to in 2015 and was actually successfully accepted onto but I made the mistake of not going with my gut instinct and taking that opportunity. Part of this fresh start for me is about exorcising some of my personal demons to overcome these fears and listen more to my heart and not be too influenced by certain people around me.
